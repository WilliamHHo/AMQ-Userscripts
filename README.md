### [Answer Shortcuts](https://github.com/WilliamHHo/AMQ-Userscripts/raw/main/amqAnswerShortcuts.user.js)
 Allows you to type manually made shortcuts for anime titles without the need of dropdown.

### [Custom Game Commands](https://github.com/WilliamHHo/AMQ-Userscripts/raw/main/AMQCustomGameCommands.user.js)
Chat commands for various custom game modes. Currently can assign roles for Spy vs. Spy and Find the Aliens game modes. Can also assign Warlords or team orders for Relays if a random order is wanted.

### [Hide Blocked Player Lobbies](https://github.com/WilliamHHo/AMQ-Userscripts/blob/main/amqHideBlockedPlayerLobbies.user.js)
Hides all rooms containing blocked players.

### [Skip Buffering](https://github.com/WilliamHHo/AMQ-Userscripts/raw/main/AMQSkipBuffering.user.js)
Skips the answer reveal phase even if there's supposed to be buffering. This may risk not having any sound on the next song.
