### [Custom Game Commands](https://github.com/WilliamHHo/AMQ-Userscripts/raw/main/AMQCustomGameCommands.user.js)
Chat commands for various custom game modes. Currently can assign roles for Spy vs. Spy and Find the Aliens game modes. Can also assign Warlords or team orders for Relays if a random order is wanted.

### [Skip Buffering](https://github.com/WilliamHHo/AMQ-Userscripts/raw/main/AMQSkipBuffering.user.js)
Skips the answer reveal phase even if there's supposed to be buffering. This may risk not having any sound on the next song.
